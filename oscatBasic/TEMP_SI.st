    (* revision history

    hm 24.1.2007		rev 1.1
    	the function would only work for TS = 25, now it works for other values of ts.

    hm 10.9.2007		rev 1.2
    	changed the function to use successive approcimation to avoid an error generated by a sqrt from a negative result.
    	changed accuracy to 0.02 degrees to shorten execution time

    hm 17. 12 2007	rev 1.3
    	improovements for better performance
